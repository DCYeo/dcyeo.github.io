# 明鏡所以照形，古事所以知今
# Welcome

I obtained my PhD in political science from Renmin University of China in 2022.

Now I’m a lecturer at School of Government, East University of Political Science and Law. I specialize in historcial political economy and public opinion, focusing on China. 

My current teaching responsibilities include: 'Political Systems of Imperial China' (中国政治制度史, a required course for undergraduate majors), 'Biographies and Evaluations of Characters in the Three Kingdoms and Two Jin Dynasties' (三国两晋人物评传, a university-wide elective course for undergraduates), and 'Thematic Research of Political Systems of Imperial China' (中国政治制度史专题研究, a graduate-level elective course).

My work has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *World Economics and Politics*, *Sociological Review of China*, *Fudan Political Science Review* and other journals.

I am also actively engaged in translation work. Several of my translations have been published or are forthcoming: 《战争之波：现代世界中的民族主义、国家形成与族群排斥》(the Chinese edition of *Waves of War: Nationalism, State Formation and Ethnic Exclusion in the Modern World* ), 《探索之道：社会科学的启发式研究法》(the Chinese edition of *Methods of Discovery: Heuristics for the Social Sciences*, co-translated with Qi Song), and 《兴衰：国家发展的社会起源》(the Chinese edition of * The Rise and Fall of Imperial China: The Social Origins of State Development*). These works are being published by Truth & Wisdom Press (格致出版社), Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House (上海文艺出版社), and Hinabooks (后浪出版集团).
