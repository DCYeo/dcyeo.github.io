# 明鏡所以照形，古事所以知今
# Welcome

I obtained my PhD in political science from Renmin University of China in 2022.

My PhD studies were conducted under the supervision of Professor Guangbin Yang (杨光斌), with substantial intellectual mentorship from Professor Tuan-Hwee Sng during my joint PhD program in National University of Singapore. I was also fortunate to work closely with Professor Yun-han Chu (朱云汉，1956-2023) as his research assistant from 2018 to 2022, during his appointment as Wu Yuzhang Chair Professor at Renmin University of China. Professor Chu's mentorship significantly shaped my academic development and research perspective.

Now I’m a lecturer at School of Government, East University of Political Science and Law. I specialize in historcial political economy and public opinion, focusing on China. 

My current teaching responsibilities include: 'Political Systems of Imperial China' (中国政治制度史, a required course for undergraduate majors), 'Biographies and Evaluations of Characters in the Three Kingdoms and Two Jin Dynasties' (三国两晋人物评传, a university-wide elective course for undergraduates), and 'Thematic Research of Political Systems of Imperial China' (中国政治制度史专题研究, a graduate-level elective course).

My work has appeared in peer-reviewed journals such as *Journal of Chinese Political Science*, *World Economics and Politics* (《世界经济与政治》), *Sociological Review of China* (《社会学评论》), *Fudan Political Science Review* (《复旦政治学评论》) and other journals.

I am also actively engaged in translation work. Several of my translations have been published or are forthcoming: 《战争之波：现代世界中的民族主义、国家形成与族群排斥》(the Chinese edition of *Waves of War: Nationalism, State Formation and Ethnic Exclusion in the Modern World* ), 《探索之道：社会科学的启发式研究法》(the Chinese edition of *Methods of Discovery: Heuristics for the Social Sciences*, co-translated with Qi Song), and 《兴衰：国家发展的社会起源》(the Chinese edition of *The Rise and Fall of Imperial China: The Social Origins of State Development*). These works are being published by Truth & Wisdom Press (格致出版社), Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House (上海文艺出版社), and Hinabooks (后浪出版集团).
